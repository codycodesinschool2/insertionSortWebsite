All this sorting algorithm does is simply go further and further into the array finding the spot of the sorted section it needs to go to and placing it there, until the sorted section grows to the full array length, then it is sorted
,This unsurprisingly is used frequently when it is required to sort a list, though most times this is required merge sort is used
